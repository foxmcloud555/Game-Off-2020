Can we call you Luke?</p>\n<p>Lucas George: You shouldn't.</p>\n<p>Home Scape: Alright, Luke! First question, what do you have to say to fans who think these new Space Force movies aren't as good as the originals?</p>\n<p>Lucas George: I think they can be safely ignored.</p>\n<p>Home Scape: Ignored? Your most loyal fans?</p>\n<p>Lucas George: Space Force is a film for 12 year olds. Those are my most loyal fans, not sweaty 30-year olds whose only bathing soap is an unopened bottle of Jars Bath Bubbles.</p>\n<p>Home Scape: Some people would say that the most recent films are too political for children. What do you have to say to that?</p>\n<p>Lucas George: I think politics have been too childish for adults.</p>\n<p>Home Scape: Before you go, can I ask you about the rumored sequel trilogy to the original Space Force trilogy?
